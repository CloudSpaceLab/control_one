# Control One — Incomplete Features & Bugs Audit

**Status:** discovery / triage list
**Date:** 2026-05-08
**Companion doc:** [`gaps-vs-probo-holmesgpt.md`](./gaps-vs-probo-holmesgpt.md)
**Method:** parallel Opus 4.7 deep-research agents tracing each issue from UI → API → DB. All findings verified against actual code with file:line citations.

> Goal: a single source of truth for everything in Control One that **doesn't work today**, so the team knows what to fix before any bank pilot demo. Issues are sorted by user-visible impact and severity, not by area.

---

## TL;DR — what's broken right now

| Area | Symptom | Root cause | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-node view: predictive health | Permanent **"Calibrating (0/24 samples)"** | Agent emits 9 metric names; predictive engine reads 7 **disjoint** names. Calibration counter is `min()` across all signals, so any missing signal pins it at 0 | **P0** |
| Single-node view: open connections | Tab shows empty even on active node | Server filter `ended_at IS NULL` excludes summary aggregates; UI client-side filter strips RFC1918 peers | **P0** |
| Single-node view: recommendations | Tab shows empty for every node | `port_observations` table has **zero writers anywhere in the codebase**; the generator's input is permanently empty | **P0** |
| Patch management | Every deploy fails with "approval required" by default | `runPatchSafetyGates` hard-codes severity=high; default `MinApprovalSeverity` is also high; no approval-then-dispatch loop | **P0** |
| Compliance results page | Failed result row shows node hostname as **plain text** — no way to navigate to the affected node | `Compliance.tsx:267-268` renders a `<span>` instead of wrapping the hostname in `navigate(\`/nodes/${id}\`)` (the pattern other pages already use) | **P1** UX |
| Knowledge graph | Comment claims firewall posture; LLM can't answer "what's surging" | KG is a hand-rolled markdown blob over 2 tables; firewall/baselines/Doris/alerts/health all unused | **P1** |
| AML gateway | PII (BVN, NIN, DOB, address) readable without auth | No `s.authorize()` on AML routes | **P0 security** |
| Sanctions client | Hardcoded `http://178.79.176.19/moov-watchman-aml` (plain HTTP) | Sanctions data unencrypted in transit | **P0 security** |
| Sanctions DOB fallback | Hardcoded `birthDate=1962-11-23` | Wrong-person matches when DOB null | **P0 correctness** |
| Session recording | OpenReplay upload silently logs "placeholder" and returns nil | `uploadToOpenReplay()` is a no-op stub | **P0 silent compliance failure** |
| Agent reliability | 15+ `panic()` / `log.Fatal` calls; any config issue crashes | Unbounded fatal exits in `cmd/nodeagent/` | **P1** |
| Process tree handler | Returns single node | Stub implementation | **P2** |
| Test coverage | 164 of 296 Go modules have no tests | Including `ai_ask`, `compliance_evidence`, `dlp_scan`, `anomaly_baselines` | **P2** |

The first four rows are all reachable from the production deployment at `https://control-one.cloudspacetechs.com/console/nodes/0d4893c0-867a-4bf1-8aa9-e247680280ab` and represent **the entire visible state** of the single-node view + patch page right now.

## 1. The Single-Node View is broken in three independent places

Three separate failures, all at the **agent ↔ controlplane contract boundary**, not a single ingestion outage.

### 1.1 "Calibrating (0/24 samples)" sticks forever

**Trace:**
- UI: `ui/src/pages/NodeDetail.tsx:116` — `Calibrating (${calibratingSamples ?? 0}/24 samples)`, sourced from `health.components.calibrating_samples`.
- Calibration counter: `controlplane/internal/server/node_predictive.go:494-539` — `scorePredictForTenant` queries `ListTelemetryMetrics` per signal, takes `min(len(samples))` across **all** signals, gates on `< 24`. When any metric has 0 rows, `minSamples = 0` → permanent `risk_level='calibrating'`.
- Signals queried (`node_predictive.go:63-111`): `host.iowait_pct`, `host.swap_used_pct`, `host.load_avg_ratio`, `host.oom_events_count`, `smart.reallocated_sector_count`, `smart.uncorrectable_errors`, `net.packet_loss_pct`, `net.icmp_latency_p99`.
- Agent emitter (`internal/util/sysinfo.go:53-85` `CollectHostMetrics`): emits `cpu_usage_percent`, `cpu_count`, `memory_total_bytes`, `memory_used_percent`, `disk_usage_percent`, `disk_total_bytes`, `load1`, `load5`, `load15`. **Nine names.**

**Root cause (confirmed):** the agent never emits any of the eight metric names the engine reads. There is no SMART collector, no OOM collector, no `iowait`, no ICMP/packet-loss anywhere in `internal/`. Repo-wide grep for `iowait|swap_used|oom_events|reallocated_sector|uncorrectable_errors|packet_loss|icmp_latency|psi_|pressure` returns zero hits outside one comment in `procmon/collector.go:10`.

**Fix sketch (two-front, both required):**
1. **Agent-side** (`internal/util/sysinfo.go:53`): add Linux PSI-derived `host.iowait_pct` (read `/proc/pressure/io` or compute from `cpu.Times.Iowait/Total`); `host.swap_used_pct` from `mem.SwapMemory()`; `host.oom_events_count` from `/proc/vmstat` `oom_kill` delta; `host.load_avg_ratio` = `Load1/cpuCount`; `net.packet_loss_pct` and `net.icmp_latency_p99` from a periodic ICMP probe to the controlplane gateway; SMART (`smart.*`) via `smartctl -A -j` per discovered block device. Linux-only is fine — fail-safe to omitting on macOS/Windows so the predictive gate still resolves once iowait/swap/oom/load/icmp are present.
2. **Server-side** (`node_predictive.go:493-508`): change calibration semantics to skip *missing* signals from the `min()` calculation. Otherwise rolling out one signal at a time keeps every node calibrating until the slowest-deployed signal catches up. Treat absent signals as "no penalty, no calibration vote." Expose per-signal sample counts in `components` so operators see which signal is the laggard.
3. Update `controlplane/internal/server/telemetry.go:59-69` `metricUnits` to add units for the new names (`pct` / `count` / `ms`).

**Faster compromise (1 day):** rename `healthSignalsCatalog()` to query the keys the agent already sends (`cpu_usage_percent`, `memory_used_percent`, `load1`-derived) and downgrade SMART/OOM/ICMP signals to "optional." Calibration completes ~24 minutes after onboarding at the default 60 s telemetry interval.

**Diagnostic recipe (operator on live deployment):**
```sql
-- 1. Confirm zero rows for predictive signals
SELECT metric_name, COUNT(*) FROM telemetry_metrics
WHERE node_id='<uuid>' AND timestamp > now() - interval '2 hours'
GROUP BY metric_name ORDER BY 1;
-- Expected: rows for cpu_usage_percent/memory_used_percent/load1; ZERO rows for smart.*/host.iowait_pct/etc.

-- 2. Confirm calibrating gate hit
SELECT score, risk_level, components, computed_at
FROM node_health_scores WHERE node_id='<uuid>';
-- Expected: risk_level='calibrating', components->>'calibrating_samples'='0'.

-- 3. Confirm agent ticks succeed
journalctl -u controlone-agent | grep telemetry.metrics.sent
-- Expected: components: 9 (or fewer on macOS).
```

### 1.2 Open connections tab empty

**Trace:**
- UI: `ui/src/pages/NodeDetail.tsx:484-640` — `ConnectionsTab` calls `api.listConnections({tenantId, nodeId, openOnly: true, since: -24h, limit: 250})`.
- Endpoint: `controlplane/internal/server/connections_query.go:23-67` — requires `s.dorisClient` (returns 503 if nil); calls `dorisClient.ListConnectionsForNode`.
- Doris query: `controlplane/internal/doris/reader_events.go:78-118` — `WHERE … AND ended_at IS NULL ORDER BY threat_match DESC, started_at DESC`.
- Agent emitter: `internal/netflow/collector.go:165-237` with smart filter at `internal/netflow/filter.go:25-54`. Default `CaptureExternal=true, CaptureInternalSummary=true`. **Critically: summary events take the `FilterSummary` branch and return without publishing** (`collector.go:173-176`); only `FilterEmit` publishes `conn.open` / `conn.close`.

**Root cause (multi-factor):**
1. **Server-side filter `ended_at IS NULL` excludes summary aggregates.** `conn.summary` rows have `ended_at = bucket_close`, not NULL. For a fresh node, all short-lived flows roll up into summaries → none satisfy the filter.
2. **UI client-side filter strips RFC1918 peers** (`NodeDetail.tsx:520-523` rejects 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16, 169.254/16, loopback) AND requires `bytes>0 || threat_match || direction==='inbound'`. On dev/internal nodes where most traffic is RFC1918, every row gets stripped client-side — API may return rows but UI shows the empty-state copy.

**Fix sketch:**
- `ui/src/pages/NodeDetail.tsx:520-523`: drop the `externalPeerIP` filter behind a "External only" toggle (default off). Operators *do* want to see internal flows on a single-node view.
- `controlplane/internal/doris/reader_events.go:88`: when `openOnly=true`, change to `(ended_at IS NULL OR last_data_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE)` so recent summary buckets count as "open enough."
- Add a fallback to `event_rollups_hourly` / netflow data so the view degrades gracefully when Doris is empty.

### 1.3 Recommendations tab empty

**Trace:**
- UI: `ui/src/pages/NodeDetail.tsx:884-908` — `RecommendationsTab` calls `api.listRecommendations(tenantId)` (tenant-scoped only — no `node_id`), filters client-side by `evidence.node_id === nodeId || !evidence.node_id`.
- Endpoint: `controlplane/internal/server/recommendations.go:33-108` — calls `s.store.AggregatePortObservations(ctx, tenantID, since=NOW()-30d)`. Requires ≥ 50 samples per `(port, protocol)` AND ≥ 95% dominant-state ratio.
- Source table: `port_observations` (migration `0046_port_observations.up.sql`).
- Writer: `controlplane/internal/storage/correlation.go:229-242` `Store.CreatePortObservation` — **defined but has zero non-test callers anywhere in the codebase.** Verified: agent never POSTs port observations; service collector posts to `node_services` only (`cmd/nodeagent/services.go:339`, `controlplane/internal/server/knowledge_graph.go:94-159`).

**Root cause (confirmed):** the recommendations generator's input table is **never written**. Permanently empty → `AggregatePortObservations` returns `[]` → endpoint returns `{"data": []}` for every tenant. Even rows the engine *could* produce never carry `evidence.node_id` (`recommendations.go:88-95` only stores `samples / state_counts / window_days`), so the UI's per-node filter would still hide them.

**Fix sketch:**
1. **Bridge `node_services` → `port_observations`** in `handleNodeServicesIngest` (`knowledge_graph.go:148`): for each service in the payload call `store.CreatePortObservation({TenantID, NodeID, Port, Protocol, State: probeStatus(svc)})`. This generates one observation per service-collector tick (5–15 min default) and feeds the existing aggregator.
2. **Stamp `evidence.node_id`** in `recommendations.go:88-95`.
3. **Add a `?node_id=` filter** to `handleRecommendations` — push per-node scoping into SQL.

### 1.4 100-word verdict

Three independent failures, all rooted in **incomplete agent ↔ controlplane wiring**, not a single ingestion outage. Predictive scoring queries names the agent has never emitted (pure naming/coverage gap). Connections rows likely *do* exist in Doris but are doubly filtered (server-side `ended_at IS NULL` excludes summaries, UI strips RFC1918 peers). Recommendations input table `port_observations` has no writers; the generator is a dead loop. Fix order: 1.3 (smallest, highest-value), then 1.1 (rename metrics), then 1.2 (Doris filter + UI toggle).

## 1.5 Compliance results — failed row has no navigation to the affected node

**Symptom (operator-reported):** when a compliance result fails, the table row shows the node hostname but there's no way to click through to the affected node's detail page. Operator has to copy the hostname or UUID and paste it into the URL bar.

**Trace:**
- UI table column: `ui/src/pages/Compliance.tsx:263-270`
  ```tsx
  {
    id: 'node',
    header: 'Node',
    cell: ({ row }) => {
      const node = nodes.find((n) => n.id === row.original.node_id);
      return <span className="text-sm text-foreground">{node?.hostname || row.original.node_id || '—'}</span>;
    },
  },
  ```
- The `node_id` is present on every row (`row.original.node_id` at line 267), but it's rendered inside a non-interactive `<span>`.
- The pattern for navigating to a node *already exists* in this codebase: `navigate(\`/nodes/${id}\`)` at `ui/src/pages/Nodes.tsx:967, 1070, 1102, 1195`. Compliance.tsx just doesn't use it.
- Same pattern likely missing on the audit log, security events, and alerts tables — worth a sweep.

**Root cause (confirmed):** plain-text render where a `<button onClick>` or `<Link to>` should be. Single-line UX bug, high-friction for the on-call workflow ("compliance just failed → which node? → click → see why").

**Fix sketch (~30 min):**
```tsx
import { useNavigate } from 'react-router-dom';
// ...
const navigate = useNavigate();
// ...
{
  id: 'node',
  header: 'Node',
  cell: ({ row }) => {
    const node = nodes.find((n) => n.id === row.original.node_id);
    if (!row.original.node_id) return <span className="text-text-muted">—</span>;
    return (
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => navigate(`/nodes/${row.original.node_id}`)}
        className="text-sm text-link hover:underline"
      >
        {node?.hostname || row.original.node_id}
      </button>
    );
  },
},
```

**While in there**: extend the same fix to any other page that displays `node_id` as text — likely the alerts table, the audit log, the security events list, and any "investigation" surface. A grep for `row.original.node_id` and `node?.hostname` will surface them.

**Bigger fix (P2):** introduce a `<NodeLink nodeId={...} fallback="—" />` shared component so this pattern is one place, not N. Then reuse it across compliance, alerts, audit log, security events, and any future entity table that references nodes.

---

## 2. Knowledge graph & auto-documentation are ~15% delivered

`controlplane/internal/server/knowledge_graph.go:235-323` builds a per-tenant Markdown blob from **two** data sources only: `nodes` and `node_services`. Then `ai_ask.go:228-250` stuffs the entire blob into the system prompt with `cache_control: ephemeral` and ships the user's question. Single-shot, no `tool_use`, no streaming.

**The intro paragraph at `knowledge_graph.go:263-267` lies.** It promises "OS, agent version, listening services and their detected URLs, and **firewall posture**." There is no firewall code path — `NodeFirewallState` exists in storage (`storage/node_firewall_state.go:34`) but `buildKnowledgeGraphCtx` never calls it. Same for `NodePackages`, `NodeHealthScore`, `Alerts`, `AnomalyBaselines`, all Doris event tables. The UI page description (`KnowledgeGraph.tsx:154`, `Ask.tsx:66`) repeats the false promise.

**Auto-documentation parity:**

| Field a bank operator expects | In KG? | Storage source available? |
|---|---|---|
| OS / arch / agent | ✅ | `nodes` |
| Listening services / ports | ✅ | `node_services` |
| Firewall posture | ❌ (claimed but absent) | `node_firewall_state` |
| Hardware (CPU/RAM/disk) | ❌ | partial — `nodes` |
| Recent changes | ❌ | `dashboard_events`, audit log |
| Compliance state | ❌ | `compliance_aggregation`, `framework_control_mappings` |
| Recent alerts | ❌ | `storage/alerts.go` |
| Recent connections | ❌ | Doris `process_connections` |
| Vulnerabilities | ❌ | `node_packages` + CVE feed (CVE feed not landed) |
| Health score | ❌ | `node_health_scores` |
| Patch status | ❌ | `patch.go` |
| Ownership / runbooks | ❌ | not modeled |

**Cache invalidation is incorrect.** Invalidated only on `POST /nodes/{id}/services` upload (`knowledge_graph.go:156`). Not on node enroll/decommission/hostname change, firewall upsert, public-IP rotation, agent-version bump, OS reinstall — all flow through `nodes` updates with no cache touch. Process-local cache also means in a multi-replica controlplane each pod has its own; one upload invalidates one replica only.

**Closure plan (3 options, ordered by effort):**

- **A — Minimal enrichment (~2 days):** extend `buildKnowledgeGraphCtx` to fetch and append per-node firewall, health score, top-5 alerts, top-5 connections from Doris, anomaly baseline delta. Keep Markdown shape, just enrich. Fix invalidation hooks. **Highest ROI.**
- **B — Tool-shaped (~1 week):** replace the inlined KG with a `tool_use` turn over thin wrapper tools (`get_node_summary`, `top_connections(node, window)`, `recent_alerts(node, since, severity)`, `surge_signal(node)`, `compliance_state(node)`). This is the chat-first P0 from the gap doc and supersedes A.
- **C — Real KG store (~3-6 weeks):** Apache AGE on existing Postgres or Dgraph sidecar. Don't build until B is in production and you can point at queries B can't answer.

**Auto-documentation as a separate surface.** Split it. Propose:
```
GET /api/v1/nodes/{id}/documentation        → application/json
GET /api/v1/nodes/{id}/documentation.md     → text/markdown
```
JSON shape composes `node + firewall + health + services + packages + recent_alerts + recent_changes + top_connections + surge + compliance + ownership`. Single `s.store.GetNodeDocumentation()` aggregator fanning out existing storage methods + one `doris.Reader` call. Cache 60 s per node. Then the per-tenant KG becomes a `for each node, render that template, concat`.

This makes the KG a **derived view** of node-level documentation — adding a field shows up in both places. Fixes the lying-comment problem and closes the auto-documentation gap simultaneously.

## 3. Patch management — works on paper, blocked by default

Audit traced agent collection → ingest → deploy model → execution → CVE linkage → UI. The full pipeline:

| Stage | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Agent package collection (apt/rpm/winget) | ✅ Working | `cmd/nodeagent/inventory.go:30`, `heartbeat.go:240-291`. macOS returns `(nil, nil)` — no brew/macports collector. |
| Ingest to `node_packages` | ✅ Working | `controlplane/internal/server/heartbeat.go:440-510`, full replace via `ReplaceNodePackages`. |
| Deployment schema | ✅ Working | `0083_patch_deployments.up.sql`, `0087_patch_proxy_squid.up.sql`. Fields coherent. |
| Direct-mode deploy flow | ⚠️ **Default-blocked** (see below) | API → `node_patch_state` row → heartbeat PendingAction → agent runs apt/yum/winget → reports back → rollup. Works *if* config is tuned. |
| Proxy / airgapped modes | ❌ Wired but unreachable from UI | Heartbeat hard-codes `patch.deploy_direct` (`heartbeat.go:259`); proxy/airgapped action prefixes are dead |
| `patch.inventory_scan` | ❌ Dead code | Job type registered, agent path exists, **no scheduler ever creates the job** |
| CVE / KEV linkage | ❌ Confirmed absent | Zero refs to `cve\|cvss\|kev\|nvd\|osv` in `controlplane/`. Pure bulk-upgrade model. |
| UI page | ⚠️ Functional but shallow | See breakdown below |

### 3.1 The blocker — every deploy fails by default

`runPatchSafetyGates` at `controlplane/internal/server/patch.go:341` **hard-codes severity = "high"**. `DefaultTenantRemediationConfig` at `tenant_remediation_config.go:47` sets `MinApprovalSeverity = "high"`. With no operator config the gate fires `EventRemediationApprovalRequested` and returns `false` → response shows every node `gate_blocked: "approval required"` and **nothing dispatches**. There is **no approval-then-redispatch loop**, so the deploy is dead unless tenant config is hand-edited.

**Fix options:**
- **Quick (4–6 h):** lower the synthesised severity to "medium" or add a tenant flag `patch_requires_approval=false` (default).
- **Proper (2–3 d):** wire an actual approval-then-dispatch loop — approver receives the event, signs off, the gate re-evaluates and dispatches.

### 3.2 UI gaps

`ui/src/pages/PatchManagement.tsx` (933 lines): three-tab shell (Deployments / Proxies / Windows). KPI tiles render. Deployments table works. But:
- **No node-selector** — the only deploy button is fleet-wide; cannot pick a subset even though the API supports `node_ids`.
- **No installed-package view** — `node_packages` has data; no API or UI surfaces it. A bank pilot will ask "show me what's installed on host X" and there's no answer.
- **No upgradable-packages preview** (because `patch.inventory_scan` is unscheduled).
- **No CVE / vendor-advisory column anywhere.**
- **NodeConfigEditor cannot pick `proxy_id` or `window_id`** — both fields exist on `patchConfigUpsertRequest` (`patch.go:704-709`) but the UI never sends them. Proxy mode is effectively unselectable.

### 3.3 Top-5 fixes for a bank pilot demo

1. **Fix the approval-gate default** (`patch.go:341`) — quick flag or proper loop. **4–6 h or 2–3 d.**
2. **Add a node-selector to the Deploy form** — replace `confirm()` with a proper modal sending `node_ids`. **4–6 h.**
3. **Ship a "Packages installed on this node" tab** at `/api/v1/nodes/{id}/packages` against `node_packages` + node-detail UI tab. Data is already there. **6–8 h.**
4. **Schedule `patch.inventory_scan` daily** and surface available-upgrades count per node + a fleet KPI tile. **1 d** (cron + agent code already exists; store count column on `node_inventory_sync`).
5. **Fix the heartbeat action prefix** to look up the job's actual type rather than hard-coding `JobTypePatchDeployDirect` (`heartbeat.go:259`); add the matching cases to the completion switch. Otherwise proxy/airgapped silently misroutes. **2–3 h.**

### 3.4 v1 verdict

Don't hide the page entirely — but **rename to "OS Updates"** (banks recoil at "patch management" because they expect CVE-driven workflows; what this product does is fleet `apt upgrade`). **Hide the Proxies and Windows tabs** until proxy_id/window_id pickers exist on the deploy form — they let you create plumbing nothing uses. After the five fixes above (~3–4 dev days), the page has a believable narrative: see installed packages → see upgradable count → push upgrade to selected hosts → watch results.

## 4. P0 security gaps (Wiki-flagged, code-confirmed)

From `Wiki/wiki/synthesis/control-one-deep-gap-analysis.md:218-230` — re-confirmed:

| # | Issue | Evidence | Fix |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **AML Gateway has NO auth on API routes** — anyone can trigger AML scans, read PII (`full_name`, BVN, NIN, DOB, address) | synthesis line 220 | Add `s.authorize(roleAdmin)` to AML routes |
| 2 | **Hardcoded Moov Watchman URL with plain HTTP** (`http://178.79.176.19/moov-watchman-aml`) — sanctions data unencrypted in transit | synthesis line 221 | Move to env var, force HTTPS, pin cert |
| 3 | **SanctionsScanner hardcodes fallback `birthDate=1962-11-23`** when DOB is null | synthesis line 222 | Refuse the scan instead of silently returning a wrong-person match |
| 4 | **OpenReplay session recording is a no-op** — `uploadToOpenReplay()` logs "placeholder" and returns nil | synthesis line 223 | Either implement properly or remove the feature flag and document |

> **RESOLVED 2026-05-10 (D2 option B: removed flag — see PR #53 §11 D2)** — Session recording (OpenReplay) is intentionally not implemented in v1.1.0-pilot. The `uploadToOpenReplay()` stub, the `openreplay_api_key` / `openreplay_url` config fields, and the example-config commented hints have been removed so the compliance posture matches the actual implementation (tlog/auditx only). Revisit when a pilot bank explicitly requests session replay; reference Probo's session-replay implementation as the comparison point.

**Severity rationale:** all four are **silent compliance failures** in a regulated-industry product. Gap 4 is especially nasty — operators believe sessions are recorded for forensics but nothing is captured.

---

## 5. P1 reliability & code-quality gaps

| # | Issue | Evidence | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 5 | Agent uses `panic()` and `log.Fatal` extensively (15+ Fatal calls); any config issue crashes | synthesis line 230 | Replace with structured-error returns + exit code |
| 6 | Process tree handler is a stub (returns single node) | synthesis line 229; `process_lineage` table exists, handler is stub | P2 |
| 7 | Scanner adapters write to predictable/fixed temp paths → race conditions on concurrent scans | synthesis line 227 | P2 |
| 8 | Dashboard metrics computed on-the-fly with scalability TODOs | synthesis line 228 | P2 — fine for pilot, breaks at scale |
| 9 | **164 of 296 Go modules have no tests** — including `ai_ask`, `compliance_evidence`, `dlp_scan`, `anomaly_baselines`, scanner adapters | synthesis line 226 | P2 |
| 10 | Trivy adapter discards all CVE detail — only aggregate counts surface | synthesis line 113 | P1 — see attacks pillar in gap doc |
| 11 | Vendor table has no UPDATE endpoint (Create / List / Delete only) | synthesis line 187 | P2 |
| 12 | Evidence file storage is local temp dir (not S3 / blob) | synthesis line 174 | P2 |
| 13 | `compliance_evidence.metadata` JSONB column never read or written by Go | synthesis line 175 | P2 |
| 14 | `cluster_rollouts_test_hooks.go` shim still on `main` post-Sprint-2 merge | `Wiki/wiki/tasks/sessions/2026-04-20-control-one-sprint-2-safety-coordination.md:77` | P3 cleanup |

---

## 6. Telemetry pipeline — additional issues found

While tracing the calibration bug (§1.1), the pipeline audit surfaced these:

| # | Issue | File:Line | Severity |
|---|---|---|---|
| 15 | Dead handler `handleLegacyTelemetry` — never registered, swallows the body, doc-comment says "live handler" | `controlplane/internal/server/telemetry.go:480-490` | P3 cleanup; misleading |
| 16 | Dead handler `handleLegacyHeartbeat` — same situation | `telemetry.go:465` | P3 |
| 17 | Strict JSON decoding on ingest endpoint (`DisallowUnknownFields`); once the agent adds new envelope fields, older controlplanes silently drop the entire batch with HTTP 400 | `telemetry.go:104` | P2 — version-bump landmine |
| 18 | `MaxBytesReader = 64 KiB` on telemetry ingest — fine today; SMART per-disk + per-NIC will blow this on hosts with many disks/NICs | `telemetry.go:99` | P3 — bump to ~256 KiB or stream |
| 19 | Hourly rollups duplicated: Postgres `IncrementHourlyRollup` and Doris `events_per_hour_mv` — two sources of truth, no reconciliation | `events_ingest.go:389-394` + Doris MV | P2 — divergence-bomb |
| 20 | `largestPenalty` tie-break is alpha-sort by key — `icmp_latency_spike` always loses to `iowait_sustained` on ties | `node_predictive.go:635-650` | P3 — wrong-cause root-cause attribution on equal penalties |
| 21 | 2 h lookback + 256 sample limit on predictive engine — fine at 60 s intervals; if `MetricsInterval` drops below ~28 s, oldest samples silently truncate | `node_predictive.go:495-500` | P3 |

---

## 7. Wiki gap acknowledgement

The Wiki has **zero coverage of the live deployment** at `control-one.cloudspacetechs.com`. Greps for `cloudspacetechs`, `0d4893c0`, `Calibrating`, `samples`, `console/nodes` across `/Users/astra/Engineering/Wiki/` return no hits. No production runbook, no incident notes, no live-environment caveats.

**Suggestion:** create `Wiki/wiki/entities/control-one-production.md` with:
- Live URL + tenant
- Deployment topology
- Known-broken UI areas (this document)

## 8. Closure sequencing

**P0 — block any pilot demo (~10–14 working days):**

1. AML auth + sanctions HTTPS + DOB fallback + OpenReplay (§4 #1–#4)
2. Single-node view three fixes (§1) — recommendations (smallest), then calibration metric-name contract, then connections filter
3. Patch-management approval-gate fix (§3.1) + node-selector + packages-on-node tab + heartbeat action-prefix fix
4. Knowledge-graph minimal enrichment (§2 option A)
5. Compliance row → node navigation (§1.5) — 30-minute fix; ship with the P0 batch since on-call workflows hit it daily

**P1 — required before bank pilot signoff (~3–4 weeks):**

5. Knowledge-graph tool-shaped upgrade (§2 option B) — supersedes A; ties into gap doc P0
6. Trivy adapter parse-detail + CVE/KEV from gap doc Attacks pillar
7. Agent reliability (§5 #5) — replace `Fatal` calls
8. Process-tree handler hydration (§5 #6)
9. Test coverage on critical untested modules (§5 #9) — focus `ai_ask`, `compliance_evidence`, `anomaly_baselines`

**P2 — hardening:**

10. Dashboard metrics scalability (§5 #8)
11. Dead handler cleanup + ingest-version-bump tolerance (§6 #15–#17)
12. Vendor UPDATE + evidence S3 backend + metadata JSONB usage (§5 #11–#13)

**P3 — cleanup:**

13. Telemetry pipeline rough edges (§6 #18, #20, #21)
14. Process-tree alpha-sort tie-break (§6 #20)
15. `cluster_rollouts_test_hooks.go` shim removal

## 9. Production diagnostic addendum

For each user-reported symptom on `https://control-one.cloudspacetechs.com/console/nodes/0d4893c0-867a-4bf1-8aa9-e247680280ab`, the recipe is:

| Symptom | First check | Confirms |
|---|---|---|
| "Calibrating (0/24 samples)" | `SELECT metric_name, COUNT(*) FROM telemetry_metrics WHERE node_id='0d4893c0-867a-4bf1-8aa9-e247680280ab' AND timestamp > now() - interval '2 hours' GROUP BY metric_name;` | If only `cpu_usage_percent`/`memory_used_percent`/`load1` appear → §1.1 confirmed |
| Empty connections | `SELECT count(*), bool_or(ended_at IS NULL) FROM process_connections WHERE node_id='0d4893c0-867a-4bf1-8aa9-e247680280ab' AND started_at > now() - interval '24 hours';` | If count > 0 but `bool_or = false` → §1.2 confirmed |
| Empty recommendations | `SELECT count(*) FROM port_observations WHERE tenant_id='<tenant>';` | If 0 → §1.3 confirmed |

Run all three; share the results in the PR thread.
